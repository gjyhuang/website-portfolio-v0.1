            <p>
              I'm a writer, an artist, a designer, and a translator. I've spent
              years living in countries like Japan, China, and South Africa.
              I started out in journalism and teaching, but my time abroad showed
              me what sorts of innovations could better people's lives versus what
              was available to them. I really wanted to make a different kind of
              impact - while designing some pretty awesome things in the process -
              and thus made the switch to software development!

            <p>
              I graduated from Fullstack Academy via the Web Development Fellowship
              offered by NYC's Tech Talent Pipeline, where I gained proficiency in JavaScript,
              Node/Express, React, Redux, Postgres, and Sequelize. I have a strong knowledge
              of RESTful APIs and TDD, having built test suites using Jasmine, Mocha, Jest,
              and Enzyme. I also have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, SCSS, and web design.

            <p>
              I'm fluent in Japanese and Shanghainese. I'm really interested in gamifying
              mundane or difficult tasks and building good habits. (Which is a work in progress
              for me, too.) You can find me trying to carve out time to work on my novels and
              illustrations, or dabbling in music and cardistry/sleight of hand, whenever I can.
              I also love to mentor and teach!

            I have built a number of apps during my time as a student and freelance developer,
            and also have a myriad of solo and team projects under my belt.

              Built as a solo project for the Tech Talent Pipeline with Node, Postgres, React, Redux, and SCSS.

              I built the front end with React Native, Redux, and Styled Components, and implemented real-time chat using Firebase.
